# Chapter 1: What is Business Analysis? - Presentation Manuscript

## Slide 1: Title Slide - What is Business Analysis?

**Opening Statement:**
Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today we're going to explore one of the most critical yet often misunderstood disciplines in modern business - Business Analysis. This is our first chapter in understanding what Business Analysis truly is, beyond the common misconceptions and unclear definitions that persist in many organizations.

**Key Speaking Points:**
- Business Analysis has evolved significantly over the past two decades
- Many professionals and organizations still struggle to define what a Business Analyst actually does
- This session will provide clarity on the discipline, role, and value that Business Analysis brings
- We'll explore not just the "what" but also the "why" and "how" of Business Analysis

**Transition:** Let's start by understanding why this book and this discipline came to be...

## Slide 2: Introduction & Purpose

**Opening Statement:**
The reason this field has gained such prominence is simple - there's a critical gap in how organizations approach business change, and Business Analysis fills that gap.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**On Evolution (20+ years):**
- Business Analysis didn't exist as a formal discipline until the 1980s-1990s
- It emerged from the growing complexity of business-technology integration
- Unlike traditional roles, BA spans multiple domains - business, technology, and change management

**On Alignment:**
- The core purpose is ensuring alignment between what the business needs and what solutions are actually delivered
- This seems obvious, but in practice, this alignment is often missing
- Many projects fail not because of poor technology, but because of poor alignment

**On Broader Scope:**
- Emphasize that BA work extends far beyond IT systems
- Business processes often need fundamental redesign
- Job roles may need to be redefined or created
- Organizational structures might need adjustment
- Training and change management are critical components

**On Clarity Issues:**
- Even today, many organizations hire "Business Analysts" without clear role definitions
- This creates confusion for both the analysts and the organization
- Different organizations define the role very differently

**Transition:** So what specific problems does Business Analysis address? Let's examine the challenges that led to this discipline's development...

## Slide 3: Key Problems in Business Analysis

**Opening Statement:**
Before we can appreciate the value of Business Analysis, we need to understand the problems it was created to solve. These are real, persistent issues that organizations continue to face today.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**Requirements Documentation Focus:**
- Many organizations treat BAs as "requirements documenters"
- The focus becomes capturing what stakeholders say they want, rather than understanding what they actually need
- This leads to solutions that technically meet requirements but fail to deliver business value
- Example: "The system does exactly what we specified, but it doesn't solve our real problem"

**IT Background Limitations:**
- Many early BAs came from systems analysis backgrounds
- They were excellent at technical analysis but struggled with business context
- They could model data and processes but couldn't challenge business assumptions
- This led to technically sound but business-irrelevant solutions

**Business Background Limitations:**
- BAs with strong business knowledge but limited IT understanding
- They understood the business need but couldn't effectively communicate with technical teams
- Gap between business vision and technical implementation
- Often resulted in miscommunication and failed projects

**Underutilized Expertise:**
- Experienced BAs often see opportunities for business improvement
- Organizations sometimes view BAs as "order takers" rather than advisors
- Governance focuses on process compliance rather than business value
- This wastes the analytical and strategic thinking capabilities of skilled BAs

**Transition:** These problems didn't arise in isolation. Let's look at the historical context that created the need for Business Analysis...

## Slide 4: Origins of Business Analysis

**Opening Statement:**
To understand where Business Analysis is going, we need to understand where it came from. The origins of this discipline lie in the fundamental changes in how organizations use technology and approach business improvement.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**Historical Context:**
- In the early days of computing, IT departments focused primarily on automating existing processes
- The goal was efficiency - doing the same things faster and with fewer errors
- IT was seen as a support function, not a strategic enabler
- Business and IT operated in separate silos

**Shift to Strategic IT:**
- Technology began enabling entirely new ways of doing business
- The question changed from "How can we automate this process?" to "What new products and services can technology enable?"
- Examples: Online banking, e-commerce, mobile applications
- IT became a competitive differentiator, not just a cost center

**New Business Models:**
- Technology enabled global operations through better communication
- Organizations could focus on core competencies while outsourcing peripheral functions
- Supply chain integration became possible
- Customer relationship management was revolutionized

**The Growing Gap:**
- Despite technological advances, business satisfaction with IT remained low
- Projects consistently over-ran budgets and timelines
- The Financial Times study mentioned shows this is still a problem today
- The fundamental issue: technology capability was advancing faster than organizational ability to effectively utilize it

**Communication Breakdown:**
- Business people couldn't articulate their needs in terms technical people could understand
- Technical people built systems that met specifications but not business needs
- No one was bridging this gap effectively

**Transition:** Several specific factors accelerated the development of Business Analysis as a distinct discipline...

## Slide 5: Development Drivers

**Opening Statement:**
Three major trends in business and technology created the perfect storm that necessitated the Business Analysis discipline. Let's examine each of these drivers and how they shaped the role we know today.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**1. Impact of Outsourcing:**
- Organizations began outsourcing IT to reduce costs and access specialized skills
- Often involved geographical separation between business users and developers
- Time zone differences complicated communication
- Cultural and language barriers added complexity
- The traditional model of informal communication between business and IT broke down
- Formal requirements definition became essential
- Someone needed to act as a bridge between business needs and external development teams
- This "someone" became the business analyst

**2. Competitive Advantage Through IT:**
- Organizations recognized that IT could provide competitive advantage, not just operational efficiency
- Three critical success factors emerged:
  - **Business-driven development:** Technology solutions must address real business needs, not just technical possibilities
  - **Holistic implementation:** IT system implementation must be accompanied by complementary business changes
  - **Rigorous requirements:** Requirements must be defined with unprecedented accuracy and detail
- Traditional systems analysts could handle the third factor but not the first two
- This created the need for professionals who could work across business and technology domains

**3. Business Change Programs:**
- Evolution from "IT projects" to "business change programs"
- Recognition that successful change requires multiple types of expertise:
  - Program managers for overall coordination
  - Change managers for organizational and cultural aspects
  - Business analysts for requirements and solution definition
- Business analysts needed to understand not just what to build, but why it was being built and how it would be used

**Transition:** This evolution led to a specific lifecycle model for business change, which helps us understand where Business Analysis fits...

---

## Slide 6: Business Change Lifecycle

**Opening Statement:**
One of the key insights in Business Analysis is that successful business change follows a predictable lifecycle. Understanding this lifecycle helps us see where Business Analysis adds the most value.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**Alignment Phase:**
- Understanding the business strategy and objectives
- Identifying how the proposed change supports these objectives
- Ensuring stakeholder buy-in and shared vision
- Business analysts contribute by helping translate strategy into actionable requirements

**Definition Phase:**
- Detailed analysis of current state and desired future state
- Identification of gaps and opportunities
- Definition of business requirements and success criteria
- This is where Business Analysis is most critical - getting the definition right determines everything that follows

**Design Phase:**
- Creation of detailed solution designs
- Technical architecture and system design
- Process design and organizational design
- Business analysts ensure designs meet business requirements

**Implementation Phase:**
- Building, testing, and deploying the solution
- Training users and supporting change adoption
- Business analysts often lead user acceptance testing and change support

**Realisation Phase:**
- Measuring actual benefits against predicted benefits
- Identifying and addressing shortfalls
- Continuous improvement and optimization
- Business analysts play a key role in benefits measurement and realization

**Key Insight:**
- Many organizations jump straight to Design or Implementation
- Without proper Alignment and Definition, projects are almost guaranteed to fail
- Business Analysis is most valuable in the early phases but contributes throughout

**Transition:** This lifecycle model helps explain why many organizations now view Business Analysts as internal consultants...

---

## Slide 7: Business Analysts as Internal Consultants

**Opening Statement:**
One of the most significant developments in Business Analysis has been the recognition that BAs can and should function as internal consultants. This represents a fundamental shift in how the role is viewed and utilized.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**The External Consultant Model:**
- Organizations have long used external consultants for business advice
- Consultants bring objectivity, broad experience, and specialized expertise
- However, external consultants also have significant limitations
- This created an opportunity for internal professionals to fill the consultant role

**Cost Advantages:**
- External consultants often charge 2-3 times the daily rate of internal staff
- No overhead costs for travel, accommodation, or extended learning periods
- For ongoing or multiple projects, internal BAs are significantly more cost-effective

**Speed Advantages:**
- Internal BAs already understand the organization's culture, politics, and constraints
- No time wasted on organizational orientation
- Existing relationships with key stakeholders
- Faster project startup and execution

**Knowledge Retention:**
- When external consultants leave, they take their knowledge with them
- Internal BAs accumulate organizational knowledge over time
- This knowledge becomes increasingly valuable for future projects
- Creates institutional memory and learning

**Accountability:**
- Internal BAs must "live with" the consequences of their recommendations
- This creates stronger incentive for practical, implementable solutions
- External consultants may recommend theoretically optimal solutions that are practically difficult
- Internal BAs balance optimal solutions with organizational realities

**Domain Expertise:**
- Deep understanding of industry-specific challenges and opportunities
- Knowledge of regulatory requirements and compliance issues
- Understanding of customer base and market dynamics
- This domain expertise is often more valuable than general consulting skills

**Transition:** Given these advantages, what exactly is the scope of work that Business Analysts can and should undertake?

---

## Slide 8: The Range of Analysis Activities

**Opening Statement:**
One of the challenges in defining Business Analysis is that it sits at the intersection of several different types of analysis work. To understand the BA role, we need to see how it relates to these other disciplines.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**The Three-Circle Model:**
- This model helps us understand the boundaries and overlaps between different types of analysis
- Each circle represents a distinct discipline with its own focus and expertise
- Business Analysis is positioned in the center because it draws from and contributes to both other areas

**Strategic Analysis (Top Circle):**
- High-level organizational strategy and direction
- Market analysis, competitive positioning, business model design
- Typically the domain of senior executives and strategy consultants
- Long-term focus, broad scope, significant organizational impact

**IT Systems Analysis (Bottom Circle):**
- Detailed technical requirements and system design
- Data modeling, process modeling, system architecture
- Traditional systems analyst and technical architect domain
- Short to medium-term focus, narrow technical scope

**Business Analysis (Center):**
- Bridges strategy and implementation
- Translates business needs into actionable requirements
- Evaluates options and recommends solutions
- Medium-term focus, broad business scope

**Key Insights:**
- The overlaps are where much of the value is created
- Good strategic analysis must consider implementation implications
- Good systems analysis must understand business context
- Business Analysis ensures these connections are made

**Important Note:**
- These boundaries are not rigid
- Senior BAs may work on strategic issues
- Technical BAs may work on detailed system requirements
- The key is understanding where your work fits and ensuring appropriate connections are made

**Transition:** Let's examine each of these areas in more detail, starting with Strategic Analysis...

## Slide 9: Strategic Analysis & Definition

**Opening Statement:**
While strategic analysis is not typically the primary responsibility of Business Analysts, understanding strategy and being able to contribute to strategic thinking is increasingly important for senior BAs.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**Primary Responsibility:**
- Strategic analysis is typically led by senior management
- Strategy consultants are often brought in for major strategic initiatives
- This work requires deep understanding of markets, competition, and industry dynamics
- Most BAs are not positioned or trained to lead this type of work

**BA Supporting Role:**
- BAs don't usually lead strategic analysis, but they often support it
- They may conduct research, analyze data, or model different scenarios
- They help translate strategic concepts into operational implications
- They identify implementation challenges and opportunities

**Key Requirements for BAs:**
- **Access to Strategy Information:** BAs need to understand the strategic context of their work
- **Strategic Literacy:** Ability to read and interpret strategic documents and presentations
- **Translation Skills:** Converting strategic objectives into tactical requirements
- **Implementation Perspective:** Understanding what it actually takes to execute strategy

**Technology Strategy Role:**
- BAs are often the organization's experts on how technology can enable business improvement
- They should contribute to strategic discussions about technology opportunities
- They can identify where technology investments would have the greatest strategic impact
- They understand the practical limitations and possibilities of technology solutions

**Tactical Design:**
- While BAs may not set strategy, they often design the tactics to implement it
- Process redesign, system requirements, and organizational changes all flow from strategic decisions
- This tactical design work is critical to strategic success

**Chapter 3 Reference:**
- The book includes Chapter 3 on strategic analysis techniques
- This recognizes that BAs need strategic thinking skills even if they don't lead strategic work

**Transition:** At the other end of the spectrum, let's look at IT Systems Analysis...

---

## Slide 10: IT Systems Analysis

**Opening Statement:**
IT Systems Analysis represents the technical end of the analysis spectrum. Understanding this discipline and its relationship to Business Analysis is crucial for defining appropriate role boundaries.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**Historical Context:**
- Systems Analysis has been around for over 40 years
- Emerged with the growth of computer systems in business
- Originally focused on automating manual processes
- Well-established techniques and methodologies

**Traditional Focus:**
- Detailed specification of IT system requirements
- Data modeling - what information the system will store and process
- Process modeling - what functions the system will perform
- Interface design - how users will interact with the system
- The goal is a complete technical specification for developers

**Current Organizational Approaches:**

**Approach 1: Complete Separation**
- Some organizations separate Business Analysis and IT Analysis into different departments
- Business analysts focus on business requirements
- IT analysts (or systems analysts) focus on technical specifications
- Clear boundaries but potential for communication gaps

**Approach 2: Specialized Roles**
- "IT Business Analysts" vs. "Business Business Analysts"
- IT BAs work within IT departments and focus on technical requirements
- Business BAs work with business users and focus on business needs
- More integration but still potential for gaps

**Approach 3: Integrated Approach**
- BAs work closely with development teams throughout the project
- Particularly common in Agile development environments
- BAs participate in iterative requirement elaboration
- Close collaboration reduces communication gaps

**Key Distinction:**
- **Systems Analysts** work within a defined technical scope and consider IT solution options
- **Business Analysts** consider a range of business options, of which IT may be one component
- The scope and perspective are fundamentally different

**Agile Implications:**
- In Agile environments, the traditional waterfall separation breaks down
- BAs work directly with developers in short iterations
- Requirements are elaborated just-in-time rather than fully specified upfront
- This requires BAs to have sufficient technical understanding to communicate effectively

**Transition:** Now let's examine the core Business Analysis work that sits between these two disciplines...

---

## Slide 11: Core Business Analysis Activities

**Opening Statement:**
Having looked at the boundaries of Business Analysis, let's now focus on the core activities that define the discipline. These activities represent the unique value that Business Analysts bring to organizations.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**1. Localized Business Issues:**
- Many BA assignments start with a specific, well-defined problem
- Examples: "Our order processing is too slow," "Customers are complaining about our invoice process"
- The analyst's job is to investigate the root cause and recommend solutions
- Solutions might include process changes, system enhancements, training, or organizational changes
- Key skill: Problem-solving and root cause analysis

**2. Broad Business Investigations:**
- More complex assignments involve multiple related issues
- Example: "Our customer service operation is not meeting expectations"
- This might involve processes, systems, staffing, training, and management issues
- Requires extensive analysis of the entire business area
- Must develop a business case to justify recommended changes
- Key skills: Systems thinking, stakeholder management, business case development

**3. IT System Enhancement:**
- Focus specifically on IT systems that need replacement or enhancement
- Business requirements drive the technical specification
- May involve package selection or custom development
- In Agile environments, involves ongoing requirement elaboration and prioritization
- Key skills: Requirements engineering, technical communication, user experience design

**4. Cross-functional Value Delivery:**
- Most senior level of BA work
- Works across multiple business functions or departments
- Focus on value streams rather than individual processes or systems
- Requires extensive stakeholder relationship management
- Needs broad business domain knowledge
- Key skills: Value stream analysis, senior stakeholder management, strategic thinking

**Common Starting Point:**
- Regardless of scope, most BA work starts with understanding the current situation
- The presenting problem is rarely the complete problem
- Initial problem statements often focus on symptoms rather than root causes
- First task is often to clarify and scope the real problem to be solved

**Importance of Problem Definition:**
- Without clear problem definition, analysis may examine the wrong areas
- Solutions that address symptoms rather than root causes will not be effective
- Time spent on proper problem definition saves much more time later

**Transition:** All of this work requires a holistic view of the business, which brings us to one of the most important models in Business Analysis...

## Slide 12: The POPIT Model: Holistic Business View

**Opening Statement:**
One of the fundamental principles of Business Analysis is taking a holistic view of business systems. The POPIT model provides a framework for ensuring we consider all aspects of a business system and their interconnections.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**Why a Holistic Approach:**
- Business problems are rarely isolated to a single area
- Solutions that address only one aspect often fail because they create problems elsewhere
- The interconnections between different aspects are often where the real issues lie
- Sustainable improvement requires considering all aspects together

**The Four Elements:**

**Processes:**
- Are business processes well-defined and documented?
- Do people actually follow the documented processes?
- Are there many "work-arounds" indicating process problems?
- Do processes require unnecessary movement of documents or information?
- Are there bottlenecks or delays built into the process?
- Is there potential for errors or quality issues?

**People:**
- Do staff have the required skills and knowledge?
- Are they motivated and engaged?
- Do they understand how their work contributes to business objectives?
- Are there sufficient people with the right skills?
- Are there training or development needs?
- Is there effective leadership and management?

**Organisation:**
- Is the organizational structure appropriate for the work being done?
- Are roles and responsibilities clearly defined?
- Is there effective cross-functional collaboration?
- Is the management style supportive of the business objectives?
- Are decision-making processes effective?
- Is there appropriate governance and oversight?

**Information & Technology:**
- Do staff have access to the information they need to do their jobs effectively?
- Can managers make decisions based on accurate and timely information?
- Do the IT systems support the business processes effectively?
- Are systems integrated appropriately?
- Is information accurate, complete, and up-to-date?
- Are there gaps in information or system functionality?

**The Interconnections:**
- The real power of the POPIT model is in understanding how these elements affect each other
- Example: A process improvement may require new skills (People), different organizational structure (Organisation), and system changes (Information & Technology)
- Addressing only one element while ignoring others often leads to failure

**Common Mistake:**
- Many business improvement initiatives focus primarily on Processes and Technology
- People and Organisation aspects are often treated as afterthoughts
- This frequently leads to technically sound solutions that fail in practice

**Transition:** Understanding this holistic perspective helps us define what the Business Analyst role actually entails...

## Slide 13: Core Business Analyst Role

**Opening Statement:**
After examining the context, history, and scope of Business Analysis, we can now provide a clear definition of what a Business Analyst actually does. This definition represents a consensus view that has emerged from the maturation of the profession.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**The Official Definition:**
- Read the definition slowly and emphasize key terms
- "Advisory role" - BAs are consultants and advisors, not order-takers
- "Investigating and analysing" - emphasis on analytical thinking and investigation skills
- "Business situations" - focus on business context, not just technical requirements
- "Identifying and evaluating options" - not just documenting requirements, but evaluating alternatives
- "Improving business systems" - focus on improvement and value creation
- "Elaborating and defining requirements" - detailed requirements work is part of the role
- "Effective implementation and use" - responsibility extends through implementation
- "In line with the needs of the business" - business needs drive everything

**Core Responsibilities Breakdown:**

**1. Investigate business systems with holistic view:**
- Use frameworks like POPIT to ensure comprehensive analysis
- Look beyond the obvious presenting problems
- Understand the broader business context and constraints
- Consider all stakeholders and their needs

**2. Evaluate actions to improve business system operation:**
- Don't just identify problems - recommend solutions
- Consider multiple options and evaluate their pros and cons
- Think beyond technology solutions to include process, organizational, and people solutions
- Consider implementation feasibility and organizational readiness

**3. Document business requirements for IT system support:**
- Translate business needs into clear, actionable requirements
- Use appropriate documentation standards and techniques
- Ensure requirements are testable and measurable
- Maintain traceability between business needs and system requirements

**4. Elaborate requirements during evolutionary system development:**
- Support Agile and iterative development approaches
- Work with users and developers to clarify and refine requirements
- Prioritize requirements based on business value
- Adapt to changing requirements as understanding evolves

**Key Insight:**
- These four responsibilities work together as an integrated whole
- They represent a progression from high-level business analysis to detailed implementation support
- The role requires both analytical and communication skills
- Technical knowledge is important but business understanding is paramount

**Transition:** This core definition can be extended for more senior roles and specialized situations...

## Slide 14: The Rationale for Business Analysis

**Opening Statement:**
Beyond the specific activities and responsibilities, there's a deeper rationale for Business Analysis - a set of principles that guide how BAs approach their work. These principles distinguish Business Analysis from other disciplines and explain why it adds unique value.

**Key Speaking Points:**

**1. Root Causes Not Symptoms:**
- **Why this matters:** Addressing symptoms provides temporary relief but problems recur
- **What this means:** BAs must dig deeper than the presenting problem
- **How to do it:** Use techniques like "Five Whys," fishbone diagrams, and stakeholder analysis
- **Example:** "The system is slow" might be a symptom of poor process design, inadequate training, or organizational issues
- **Holistic view:** Consider all aspects of the business system, not just the obvious technical aspects

**2. Business Improvement Not IT Change:**
- **Why this matters:** Technology is an enabler, not an end in itself
- **What this means:** Start with business improvement opportunities, then determine if/how IT can help
- **Business agility:** Solutions should make the business more flexible and responsive
- **Example:** Instead of "We need a new CRM system," ask "How can we better serve our customers?"

**3. Options Not Solutions:**
- **Why this matters:** Pre-determined solutions often aren't optimal and may not address root causes
- **What this means:** Even when stakeholders present a specific solution, explore alternatives
- **Challenge assumptions:** Question why a particular solution is being proposed
- **Evaluate alternatives:** Consider different approaches, including non-IT solutions
- **Example:** Instead of accepting "We need a new system," explore process improvements, training, or organizational changes

**4. Feasible, Contributing Requirements Not Meeting All Requests:**
- **Why this matters:** Organizations have limited resources and time
- **Financial constraints:** Understand budget limitations and cost implications
- **Timescale constraints:** Consider deadlines and resource availability
- **Business contribution:** Requirements should contribute to business objectives, not just satisfy individual requests
- **Prioritization:** Help stakeholders understand what's essential vs. nice-to-have

**5. Entire Business Change Lifecycle Not Just Requirements Definition:**
- **Why this matters:** Business change fails as often in implementation as in requirements
- **Broader involvement:** BAs should contribute throughout the change lifecycle
- **Implementation support:** Help with testing, training, and change management
- **Benefits realization:** Measure whether changes actually delivered predicted benefits

**6. Negotiation Not Avoidance:**
- **Why this matters:** Conflicting stakeholder needs are normal and must be addressed
- **Acknowledge conflicts:** Don't pretend everyone agrees when they don't
- **Facilitate resolution:** Help stakeholders find mutually acceptable solutions
- **Make trade-offs transparent:** Help stakeholders understand the implications of different choices

**Transition:** These principles have helped Business Analysis mature as a profession, which we can see in the Business Analysis Maturity Model...
