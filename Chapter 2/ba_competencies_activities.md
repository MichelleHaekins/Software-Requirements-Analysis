                    Known              Unknown
        Known   |  Quadrant 1     |  Quadrant 3  |
WHAT            |  SFIA 3-4       |  SFIA 4-5    |
(Work to        |                 |              |
be done)        |                 |              |
                |-----------------|--------------|

**Scenario 2:** A retail company wants to "improve customer experience" but hasn't defined what that means or how to measure it. They've never done a comprehensive CX analysis before.

**Scenario 3:** Implement a standard ERP module for financial reporting. The software vendor provides implementation methodology, but your organization has never used this particular ERP system.

**Scenario 4:** The CEO says "we need to be more data-driven" but can't specify what that means operationally or what success looks like. There's no established approach for organization-wide data strategy.

**Scenario 5:** Document the current process for handling customer complaints. The process is well-established, and process documentation follows company standards.

**Scenario 6:** Evaluate whether to build a custom solution or buy a commercial package for inventory management. The evaluation criteria are clear, but the organization has limited experience with this type of analysis.

### Debrief Questions:
- Which scenarios were hardest to categorize and why?
- How does this matrix help with resource planning?

### Case Study: The Struggling Business Analyst

**Background:**
Sarah is a business analyst at a mid-sized manufacturing company. She has strong technical skills and understands the software development process well. However, she's facing several challenges on her current project to implement a new inventory management system.

**Current Situation:**
- The project is 3 months behind schedule
- Stakeholders frequently change their requirements
- There's conflict between the warehouse manager and IT director
- Senior management is questioning the project's value
- Sarah feels overwhelmed and is considering leaving the company

**Specific Issues:**
1. **Communication Problems:** Sarah uses technical jargon when talking to business users. Warehouse staff seem confused during requirements meetings.

2. **Stakeholder Management:** The warehouse manager and IT director have fundamentally different views of what the system should do. Sarah has been caught in the middle of their arguments.

3. **Business Knowledge Gap:** Sarah doesn't understand inventory management principles or how the current process impacts the business financially.

4. **Requirements Issues:** Requirements keep changing because Sarah accepted initial high-level statements without digging deeper into the real business needs.

5. **Political Challenges:** Sarah recently discovered that a previous inventory system project failed, and some stakeholders are actively resistant to change.

6. **Leadership Concerns:** Sarah's manager has questioned whether she's the right person for this assignment, mentioning concerns about her "business sense" and "stakeholder relationships."
