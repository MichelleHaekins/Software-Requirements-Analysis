## Slide 1: Title Slide - The Competencies of a Business Analyst

**Opening (2-3 minutes)**

Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today we're diving into Chapter 2 of our business analysis study, focusing on "The Competencies of a Business Analyst" by Craig Rollason.

Let me start with a compelling statement from the chapter: "Good business analysts can make the difference between a poor and a great investment in business and IT improvements." This isn't just marketing speak - this is the reality of what separates effective BAs from those who merely go through the motions.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
By the end of this presentation, you'll understand:
- The three fundamental groups of BA competencies and why they matter
- Essential personal qualities that make BAs effective - these are often overlooked but absolutely critical
- The business knowledge areas that give BAs credibility and impact
- Professional techniques that truly differentiate business analysts from other roles
- How to develop these skills and what career pathways are available

**Transition:** The chapter defines competence as "the ability to do a particular activity to a prescribed standard." But for BAs, it's more than that - it's about having the ability to perform your job effectively in complex, ever-changing business environments.

## Slide 2: BA Competencies Overview

**Content Delivery (3-4 minutes)**

Craig Rollason organizes BA competencies into three broad groups, and understanding this structure is crucial because it shows how different types of skills work together.

**Personal Qualities - The Foundation:**
These are how you think and how you interact with people. Here's a critical insight from the chapter: "Behavioural skills are arguably more important than technical or business skills as they are a prerequisite for working with other people."

Think about this - you can teach someone a modeling technique in a day, but developing the emotional intelligence to navigate organizational politics? That takes years. The chapter notes it's much easier to give someone with good behavioral skills the technical knowledge they need than to graft behavioral skills onto a good technician.

**Business Knowledge - The Context:**
This is your understanding of the organization and the business domain. Without this, you're just a technician with tools. With it, you become a trusted advisor who can offer insights that improve organizational performance.

**Professional Techniques - The Differentiator:**
These are the specific skills that make you a business analyst rather than a project manager, developer, or consultant. They're your professional identity.

**Key Point:** Notice how these build on each other. Personal qualities enable you to work with people. Business knowledge gives you credibility. Professional techniques give you the tools to deliver value.

**Transition:** Let's start with personal qualities, because without these, the other two categories become much less effective.

---

## Slide 3: Personal Qualities - Communication

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

The chapter states that "Communication is perhaps the most important skill an individual can possess." In business analysis, this isn't just about being articulate - it's about being a bridge between different worlds.

**The BA Communication Challenge:**
Business analysts often work at the intersection of business and IT, between senior management and operational staff, between different departments with conflicting priorities. Poor communication skills are frequently cited as the root cause of problems in these interactions.

**Key Communication Components:**

**Building Rapport:** This isn't about being everyone's friend. It's about establishing a professional connection that makes people comfortable sharing information with you. Think about it - as a BA, you need people to tell you about problems, inefficiencies, and sometimes political issues. They won't do that unless they trust you.

**Active Listening:** This means truly understanding different perspectives, not just waiting for your turn to talk. The chapter emphasizes understanding "the other party's point of view" - this is crucial when you're trying to understand requirements or resolve conflicts.

**Influencing:** You'll often need to guide decisions without having formal authority. This requires careful preparation and understanding of stakeholder motivations.

**Building Empathy:** Understanding not just what people say, but why they're saying it and what concerns might be driving their positions.

**Best Practices from the Chapter:**
- Use language and style that business colleagues are comfortable with
- Avoid technical jargon that confuses stakeholders
- Do prior research to understand the business context
- Adjust your communication style to match your audience
- Frame questions according to participants' interests and responsibilities

**Real-world Application:** Before any stakeholder meeting, spend time understanding: Who will be there? What are their concerns? How do they prefer to receive information? What's their technical comfort level?

**Transition:** Communication enables relationship building, which is our next critical skill.

---

## Slide 4: Other Critical Personal Qualities

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

**Relationship Building:**
The chapter describes this as "an extension of communication skill" focused on getting people to "impart information and share opinions with you, and also to discuss ideas for change." 

Notice what's happening here - you need people to share information (investigation phase), share opinions (analysis phase), and discuss change ideas (solution phase). None of this happens without solid relationships.

The chapter notes that those who build good relationships demonstrate "genuine interest in the other person and offer open discussions which build mutual trust and respect." This isn't manipulation - it's authentic professional relationship building.

**Influencing - The Strategic Skill:**
This becomes critical when your analysis leads to conclusions that conflict with preconceived ideas or call for radical action. The chapter provides excellent guidance here:

First, understand the stakeholder landscape - both obvious players (sponsors, project managers, governance committees) and hidden ones (networks of colleagues, personal agendas, informal power structures).

Second, tailor your approach. Some managers want detailed analysis, others prefer high-level summaries. Some focus on technical details, others on vision and big picture.

**Team Working:**
BAs rarely work in isolation. You're collaborating with business colleagues, suppliers, project team members, and management. The chapter suggests using your analytical skills to identify team issues and improvement opportunities.

**Political Awareness - The "Elephant in the Room":**
The chapter uses a great analogy here - political awareness is "hard to describe but you know it when you see it." It's about being "streetwise" and understanding organizational dynamics.

This doesn't mean accepting the status quo - it means being astute about how to get results even when facing opposition. You need to understand sources of power, what's acceptable in the organizational culture, and how to use appropriate channels to drive change.

**Practical Example:** You've identified a process improvement that would save significant money but requires one department to give up some control. Political awareness means understanding who really makes decisions, what their concerns might be, and how to present your case in a way that addresses those concerns.

**Transition:** These interpersonal skills enable you to gather information and build support, but then you need analytical skills to make sense of what you've learned.

## Slide 5: Analytical Skills & Critical Thinking

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

Here's where we get to the heart of what makes someone a business analyst versus someone who just collects requirements. The chapter is very clear about what analytical skills mean in practice.

**What It's NOT:**
- Settling for the obvious
- Accepting things at face value  
- Jumping to premature conclusions
- Simply recording what users say they want

**What It IS:**
- Digging deeper until you uncover the true situation
- Defining the real problem, not just symptoms
- Sifting through conflicting data to determine what's relevant
- Challenging received wisdom at every turn

**The Power Questions:**
The chapter provides an excellent toolkit of questions that demonstrate analytical thinking:
- Why do you do this? (Purpose)
- What value does it add? (Benefit)
- Where is it done? (Location/Context)
- How is it done? (Process)
- Who is or should be responsible? (Accountability)
- When should it happen? (Timing)
- Is there another way to do this? (Alternatives)

**The 80/20 Rule:**
One of my favorite insights from the chapter: "Conduct 20 percent of the analysis in order to achieve 80 percent of the right answer – and then be 100 percent convincing when influencing the outcome."

This doesn't mean taking shortcuts - it means recognizing key factors and constraints rather than trying to analyze everything. It's about efficiency and focus.

**Real-world Application:** When stakeholders tell you they need a new system, your analytical skills kick in. Instead of immediately jumping to system requirements, you ask: What problem are you trying to solve? What's driving this need? What have you tried before? What would success look like?

**Critical Point:** The chapter notes that some analysts believe their job is simply recording what users want. This approach "will not reap the potential rewards without the active and critical intervention of the analyst." You're not a stenographer - you're an analyst.

**Transition:** Analytical skills help you understand problems, but you also need specific capabilities for solving them and leading change.

---

## Slide 6: Problem Solving & Leadership

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

**Problem Solving - The Core BA Mindset:**
The chapter makes a crucial point: "Too often business analysts complain that a solution is decided upon without there being a full appreciation of the problem to be addressed." This focus on understanding the problem first is "a key tenet of business analysis" and where significant value can be delivered.

**Required Mindset Elements:**
- **Curiosity:** Genuine interest in understanding how things work and why they don't work
- **Tenacity:** Persistence in digging deeper when initial answers don't make sense
- **Open Mind:** Willingness to consider multiple options and perspectives
- **Pragmatism:** Understanding that perfect solutions often don't exist - you need workable ones

**Leadership in the BA Context:**
This isn't about managing people - it's about leading change initiatives. The chapter defines BA leadership as:
- Creating a vision of approaches and options to address business issues
- Advising stakeholders to obtain agreement about that vision
- Driving the business and IT change process toward achieving the vision

**Key Insight:** "No two projects are the same. Each project has different objectives, constraints and stakeholders." This means you can't just apply templates - you need to assess each situation and design the appropriate analysis process.

**The Holistic Approach:**
The chapter emphasizes that BAs need to consider "all aspects of the organisation or business area within which they work, including people, culture, processes, commercial and technical aspects." This is systems thinking in action.

**Leadership Levels:**
The chapter references different levels of BA leadership:
- Self-leadership (managing your own work and development)
- Project leadership (leading analysis initiatives)
- Organizational leadership (influencing broader change)
- Industry leadership (contributing to the profession)

**Self-Belief - The Often Overlooked Quality:**
This means having confidence in yourself, your analysis quality, and your approach. The chapter connects this to "locus of control" - BAs with internal locus of control believe they can influence events, while those with external locus feel powerless.

**Professional Development:**
Continuous improvement is critical. This applies to personal development and enabling others to develop. In today's fast-moving environment, organizations need people who focus on ongoing learning and adaptation.

**Transition:** These personal qualities provide the foundation, but BAs also need specific business knowledge to be credible and effective.

## Slide 7: Business Knowledge - Finance

**Content Delivery (3-4 minutes)**

Here's a fundamental truth from the chapter: "The universal language of business is finance." Whether you're working in commercial, government, or non-profit sectors, financial considerations drive decision-making.

**Why Finance Matters for BAs:**
Without financial understanding, you cannot:
- Evaluate suppliers effectively
- Deliver well-thought-through process improvements
- Evaluate options in business cases
- Communicate with senior stakeholders in their language
- Understand what drives organizational priorities

**Essential Financial Knowledge Areas:**

**Financial Statements:** You need to understand balance sheets and income statements (profit and loss accounts). These tell the story of organizational health and performance.

**Analysis Tools:** Ratio analysis helps you understand financial relationships. Budgeting and cash flow analysis help you understand resource constraints and timing issues.

**Profit/Surplus Understanding:** Different types of organizations have different financial objectives, and you need to understand what drives value in your context.

**Costing Principles:** Understanding how products and services are costed helps you evaluate improvement opportunities and make realistic recommendations.

**Business Case Development:**
This is where financial knowledge becomes practical. The chapter notes that "much of the business analyst's work will be to assess the costs and benefits of delivering a project to the organisation."

**Investment Appraisal Techniques:**
- Break-even analysis: When will benefits offset costs?
- Discounted cash flow: What's the present value of future benefits?
- Risk assessment: What could go wrong financially?

**Practical Application:** When you recommend a process change, you need to quantify both costs (implementation effort, training, potential disruption) and benefits (time savings, error reduction, improved customer satisfaction). Without financial analysis, your recommendations lack credibility.

**Positive Development:** The chapter notes that many BAs have developed greater understanding of technical solution costs and benefits, enabling them to "disregard costly options quickly" and ensure they deliver value.

**Transition:** Financial knowledge provides credibility, but you also need deep understanding of your business domain.

---

## Slide 8: Domain & Technical Knowledge

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

**Domain Knowledge - Three Key Benefits:**

**1. Communication Enablement:** You can communicate with business people using language they're familiar with. Combined with the communication and relationship-building skills we discussed earlier, this creates powerful synergy.

**2. Contextual Understanding:** You understand what would and would not be acceptable or useful to your business domain. For example, profit-focused solutions make no sense in a social security department.

**3. Best Practice Application:** You can leverage ideas and experiences from your domain, or related domains, to solve current problems. This is where experience really pays off.

**Domain Levels:**
- **General Domain:** Retail, healthcare, financial services, government
- **Specific Domain:** Supermarkets within retail, social care within local government

**Subject Matter Expertise:**
This takes domain knowledge deeper into specific product lines or services. The chapter emphasizes that good understanding of terminology, processes, and constraints establishes credibility with customers.

**Benefits of Subject Matter Expertise:**
- Easier communication with business staff
- Ability to identify potential areas for change
- Recognition of improvement opportunities that outsiders might miss
- Credibility that comes from understanding the business

**Principles of Information Technology - The Bridging Role:**
The chapter acknowledges that many BAs don't come from IT backgrounds, and that's fine - "their job is not to be expert in IT-related issues." However, BA was originally conceived as a "bridging" role between business and IT.

**Essential IT Knowledge Areas:**
- **Computer Fundamentals:** Operating systems, application software, hardware, networks
- **Development Lifecycles:** Unified process, 'V' model, Agile approaches
- **Modeling Approaches:** UML and other system modeling techniques
- **Development Methods:** DSDM, Scrum, and other methodologies
- **Build vs. Buy Decisions:** Understanding trade-offs between development and purchase
- **Emerging Trends:** Big data, software as a service, visualization, mobile technologies

**Key Point:** You don't need to be a technical expert, but you need to "understand the technical terms used by IT specialists and help the business users to appreciate any impacts on the organisation."

**Agile Impact:** The increasing use of Agile approaches has placed greater responsibility on BAs to understand IT and related issues. You're more embedded in development teams and need to communicate effectively with technical staff.

**Transition:** Domain and technical knowledge provide context and credibility, but you also need specific professional techniques that define what makes you a business analyst.

## Slide 9: Professional Techniques - Part 1

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

Now we get to the techniques that specifically differentiate business analysts from other roles. These are your professional toolkit.

**Project Management:**
While you're not necessarily a project manager, understanding PM principles is crucial. The chapter references both PMI and APM bodies of knowledge covering areas like scope, time, cost, quality, communications, and risk management.

**Why BAs Need PM Skills:**
- On small teams, you might take on the PM role
- You need to understand project initiation to define your terms of reference
- You must work within project plans and understand dependencies
- You need to understand quality assurance and risk management

**Key Insight:** Even with a dedicated project manager, you need to understand the project context to be effective.

**Strategy Analysis:**
This covers techniques for understanding business direction and organizational strengths/weaknesses. Strategy analysis helps you:
- Understand where the organization is trying to go
- Identify gaps between current and desired states
- Align your analysis work with strategic objectives
- Communicate recommendations in strategic context

**Stakeholder Analysis and Management:**
The chapter calls this "a key element of business analysis." This involves:
- **Identifying stakeholders:** Who cares about this project?
- **Analyzing stakeholders:** What are their interests, concerns, and influence levels?
- **Developing management strategies:** How do you work with each stakeholder effectively?

**Critical Point:** You need to determine stakeholders in your BA project, understand their views, and work out how their interests are best managed. This isn't just about being nice to people - it's about ensuring project success.

**Investigation Techniques:**
The chapter notes that to "get to the root of a business issue," you need "a range of techniques within their toolkit in order to undertake an effective analysis of the area."

This is about having multiple ways to gather information:
- Interviews, workshops, observation
- Document analysis, data analysis
- Process mapping, root cause analysis
- Surveys, focus groups, prototyping

**Why Multiple Techniques Matter:** Different situations require different approaches. Some stakeholders communicate better in workshops than interviews. Some information is better gathered through observation than asking questions.

**Transition:** These foundational techniques enable investigation and analysis, but you also need specific techniques for requirements and modeling.

## Slide 10: Professional Techniques - Part 2

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

**Requirements Engineering:**
This is "the set of practices and processes that lead to the development of a set of well-formed business requirements, from which the business and IT solutions can be developed."

**Key Point:** It's not just about collecting requirements - it's about engineering them. This means:
- Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and testable
- Managing requirements through change processes
- Tracing requirements to business objectives
- Validating requirements with stakeholders

**Business & Data Modeling:**
**Business Modeling:** This is about visualizing business systems through conceptual models. You create both high-level business system models and detailed process models to understand how work gets done and identify improvement opportunities.

**Data Modeling:** The chapter notes that "analyzing the data held and used within a business system affords valuable insights into how a business system operates." Questions like: What data do we hold about customers? What are the relationships between customers, products, and suppliers?

**Gap Analysis - Core BA Skill:**
The chapter calls this "core to the business analyst role." Gap analysis applies in many situations:
- Comparing 'as is' and 'to be' process models
- Evaluating off-the-shelf packages against requirements
- Assessing capability needs against current capabilities
- Identifying what's missing in current solutions

**Facilitation Skills:**
While the interpersonal skills are important, facilitation also requires:
- **Process awareness:** Understanding how to prepare and run workshops
- **Technique application:** Brainstorming, mind-mapping, dialogue mapping, "day in the life of" exercises, Six Thinking Hats
- **Context sensitivity:** Choosing the right techniques for the task, participants, and organization

**Emerging Trend:** The chapter notes the rise of visualization techniques "to engage the business audience ranging from strategy level definition through to screen design." Visual approaches are quicker to understand and explain.

**Emerging Professional Areas:**

**Portfolio Management:** This is about "evaluation, prioritisation and delivery of a portfolio of projects required to deliver business strategies." Your analysis skills help assess how work fits together and where priorities lie.

**Benefits Management:** This involves "active planning, monitoring and evaluation of benefits predicted in a business case." It's not enough to predict benefits - you need to ensure they're actually delivered.

**Agile Thinking:** Beyond supporting Agile projects, this is about "enabling business agility" - helping organizations respond effectively to problems and opportunities with the right approach for each situation.

**Transition:** Understanding these techniques is important, but knowing when and how to apply them is equally critical.

## Slide 11: Skills Analysis Matrix

**Content Delivery (3-4 minutes)**

This is one of the most practical frameworks in the chapter - a way to match skill levels to situation complexity. It's based on two dimensions: what work needs to be done and how to do that work.

**Quadrant 1 - Known What, Known How (SFIA Levels 3-4):**
Both the analysis work and the process are well understood. This is perfect for new or inexperienced analysts. Example: Defining requirements for a system where the scope has already been agreed.

**Why This Works for New BAs:** Clear boundaries, established processes, lower risk. You can focus on learning techniques without having to also figure out the approach.

**Quadrant 2 - Unknown What, Known How (SFIA Levels 4-5):**
The analysis needed isn't clearly understood, but there's a standard approach. Example from the chapter: An organization wants to deploy collaborative/social media technology and has a pre-defined deployment method, but they're not sure which high-value areas should be targeted first.

**The Challenge:** You need experience to recognize what type of analysis is needed, but once identified, you can follow established approaches.

**Quadrant 3 - Known What, Unknown How (SFIA Levels 4-5):**
You understand what analysis is needed, but the approach isn't clear. Example: Moving from multiple packaged systems to a single ERP system when the organization has never done this before.

**The Challenge:** You know the destination but need to figure out the journey. This requires creativity and adaptability.

**Quadrant 4 - Unknown What, Unknown How (SFIA Level 6):**
Neither the analysis nor the approach is understood. The chapter gives examples like "we need to reduce costs," "we need to improve sales," "we need to innovate more."

**Why This Needs Senior BAs:** You may need to:
- Define how work will be performed
- Manage senior stakeholders through ambiguous processes
- Facilitate organizational thinking about objectives
- Adopt consultancy-like approaches

**Management Implication:** The chapter notes this model helps management ensure "good fit between the skills needed for the analysis to be carried out." Mismatches in either direction (under-skilled or over-skilled) can be problematic.

**Transition:** Understanding skill levels leads to the question: How do you develop these capabilities?

## Slide 12: How to Develop BA Skills

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

The chapter acknowledges that the list of skills "may appear to be rather daunting," but provides a clear development pathway.

**First Step - Critical Foundation:**
"Understand the skills required of a business analyst in your organisation" - both current and future requirements. This might come from:
- HR department or line management role definitions
- Internal career development frameworks
- External frameworks like SFIA
- Industry standards and certifications

**Four Development Methods:**

**1. Training - Structured Learning:**
**Best For:** Professional techniques, business knowledge, and some personal skills
**Benefits:** 
- Efficient knowledge acquisition
- Safe practice environment with expert guidance
- Knowledge sharing with peers enriches learning
- Can lead to industry qualifications

**Tip:** Look for courses that offer practical application, not just theory.

**2. Self-Study - Continuous Learning:**
**Best For:** Business and professional knowledge
**Resources:**
- Reference books on BA topics
- Business publications: Financial Times, Economist, Harvard Business Review
- Internet resources: specialist websites, articles, blogs
- Online courses and webinars

**Key Point:** This broadens and deepens your understanding of the business world beyond your immediate context.

**3. Workplace Experience - The Primary Developer:**
**Best For:** All skills, especially personal skills
**Enhancement Methods:**
- Formalized skills development programs
- Coaching and mentoring relationships
- Stretch assignments and project rotations
- Cross-functional team participation

**Critical Insight:** The chapter notes this is "the best arena for a business analyst to develop their personal skills." You can read about communication, but you learn it by communicating.

**4. Industry Engagement - Professional Development:**
**Opportunities:**
- Professional bodies (BCS, IIBA)
- Industry conferences and events
- Certification programs
- Networking with peers
- Contributing through presentations and articles

**Benefits:** Exposure to different approaches, building professional network, staying current with industry trends.

**Acceleration Factor:** The chapter notes that performance "can be heightened and accelerated if working within an organisation that operates a formalised skills development programme." If this isn't available, seek mentors from other organizations.

**Practical Advice:** Don't try to develop everything at once. Assess your current skills, identify the biggest gaps for your role, and focus your development efforts.

**Transition:** To support development efforts, it's helpful to understand industry frameworks and standards.

## Slide 15: Key Takeaways

**Content Delivery (4-5 minutes)**

Let me close with the key insights from this chapter and their implications for your BA career.

**Evolution of the BA Role:**
The chapter traces important evolution from simply "collecting requirements in an organised and logical fashion" to demonstrating "how they can identify, analyse and develop options for adding value to their organisation."

**Why This Evolution Matters:**
- IT projects have higher stakes and visibility
- Organizations are more IT-aware and demanding
- Sourcing options (especially offshore) make requirements definition more critical
- IT departments must demonstrate value or risk obsolescence

**Critical Success Factors:**

**1. Personal Skills - The Biggest Challenge:**
The chapter notes that "perhaps the biggest challenges lie for business analysts" in personal skills. Why? Because "anyone working in business change is only too aware of the apprehension, and even resentment, that change projects engender."

**Your Challenge:** Use all your personal skills to "invalidate the stereotypes and overcome opposition" while working with business colleagues to deliver improvements.

**2. Continuous Development:**
"Competence development is the most important aspect of career development for any professional." This isn't a one-time investment - it's a career-long commitment.

**3. Organizational Context:**
"Every organisation will have a different interpretation of what a business analyst does and the levels of business analysis work." You need to understand YOUR organization's needs and expectations.

**4. Value Demonstration:**
The stakes are getting higher. The chapter warns that business analysts "can only survive and evolve if they offer a broad set of skills that demonstrate how they can identify, analyse and develop options for adding value to their organisation."

**Practical Next Steps:**
1. Assess your current competencies against the three categories we discussed
2. Identify the biggest gaps relative to your role and career aspirations  
3. Create a development plan using the four methods: training, self-study, workplace experience, and industry engagement
4. Understand how your organization defines and values the BA role
5. Look for opportunities to demonstrate value through the problems you solve and the options you develop

**Final Thought:**
The chapter ends with a powerful reminder about the human side of business analysis. You're not just analyzing systems and processes - you're helping organizations and people navigate change. That requires the full range of competencies we've discussed today: the personal skills to work with people, the business knowledge to understand context, and the professional techniques to deliver results.

The future belongs to business analysts who can combine analytical rigor with business acumen and interpersonal effectiveness. That's your opportunity and your challenge.

**Questions and Discussion:** I'd like to open this up for questions. What aspects of these competencies resonate most with your experience? What development areas do you want to explore further?
